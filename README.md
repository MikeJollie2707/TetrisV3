Previous versions are not well-coded for extensive uses, so this version attempts to fix that.

The final goal of this version is to implement an AI to play Tetris.

## Features

- Normal Tetris
- Scoring (in terminal)
- Wall kicking
- Tetromino hinting
- Settings config through setters

## TODO

- [ ] AI
